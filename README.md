# Asma Abu - Resume Website 
The aim of this project and website is to build a brand with my coding expertise and showcase myself as an individual as well as my prospective talents to future employers. 

The website will be simple and clear to understand but still showcase my identity clearly and help future employers understand me as an employee and hopeful web developer. 

## UX

### The Strategy Plane

The website is targetted towards proffesionals and businesses. All content on the website has a purpose and is there to answer the questions of any potential employers or clients. The technology used will be fairly simple and straight forward as will the design. 

The aim of the site will be to attract more clients and prospective employers for the proffessional through showcasing their previous work and experience. 

The proffesional has a strong portfolio and career background and this will be portrayed in a clear and concise manner. The website will be informative and simple. 

The target audience is for businesses. There are a few websites available such as LinkedIN and Indeed where businesses can find employees and candidates. The purpose of this website is the same, but this is more of an extra for the proffesional which will make them stand out from other potential candidates, as oppose to an alternative.

The site won't list any pricing as this will need to be determined via follow up contact. There needs to be little persuasion as the audience is coming to the website with the intention to fulfil a goal. 

There will be content to ensure the customer, through a contact page. I will include a FAQ page, and a testimonials page along with a portfolio and resume page for this purpose. All these things will add value. 

**Insert User Experience Roadmap**

As the website will be sleek and simple and include pictures and multiple points of assurance, it will feel credible and trustworthy. It will offer all the information the prospect clients and potential employers are looking for and any further queries can be address through the contact page which will be simple and easy to use. The contact page also makes it easy for the user to learn more and and contact the proffesional is they need to. 

The home page will be simple and catchy and won't be an eye sore or look too hard to digest. The user will be able to pick up key peices of information through a quick scroll and easily navigate through the site.


<!-- Use this section to provide insight into your UX process, focusing on who this website is for, what it is that they want to achieve and how your project is the best way to help them achieve these things.

In particular, as part of this section we recommend that you provide a list of User Stories, with the following general structure:

As a user type, I want to perform an action, so that I can achieve a goal.
This section is also where you would share links to any wireframes, mockups, diagrams etc. that you created as part of the design process. These files should themselves either be included as a pdf file in the project itself (in an separate directory), or just hosted elsewhere online and can be in any format that is viewable inside the browser. !--> 

## Features
The website will feature a number of different pages which hold different purposes. 

The main page will have a reponsive navigation bar, followed by a Hero Image, 

<!-- To be completed -->
### Existing Features
Feature 1 - allows users X to achieve Y, by having them fill out Z
...
For some/all of your features, you may choose to reference the specific project files that implement them, although this is entirely optional.

In addition, you may also use this section to discuss plans for additional features to be implemented in the future:

## Technologies Used
In this section, you should mention all of the languages, frameworks, libraries, and any other tools that you have used to construct this project. For each, provide its name, a link to its official site and a short sentence of why it was used.

JQuery
The project uses JQuery to simplify DOM manipulation.

#### Google fonts 
https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Work+Sans?sidebar.open=true&preview.text_type=custom&selection.family=Work+Sans:wght@300
I used this for my Navigation font 

#### Bootstrap 
https://getbootstrap.com/docs/5.0/components/navbar/
I used this for my Navigation bar 



## Testing
In this section, you need to convince the assessor that you have conducted enough testing to legitimately believe that the site works well. Essentially, in this part you will want to go over all of your user stories from the UX section and ensure that they all work as intended, with the project providing an easy and straightforward way for the users to achieve their goals.

Whenever it is feasible, prefer to automate your tests, and if you've done so, provide a brief explanation of your approach, link to the test file(s) and explain how to run them.

For any scenarios that have not been automated, test the user stories manually and provide as much detail as is relevant. A particularly useful form for describing your testing process is via scenarios, such as:

Contact form:
Go to the "Contact Us" page
Try to submit the empty form and verify that an error message about the required fields appears
Try to submit the form with an invalid email address and verify that a relevant error message appears
Try to submit the form with all inputs valid and verify that a success message appears.
In addition, you should mention in this section how your project looks and works on different browsers and screen sizes.

You should also mention in this section any interesting bugs or problems you discovered during your testing, even if you haven't addressed them yet.

If this section grows too long, you may want to split it off into a separate file and link to it from here.

## Deployment
This section should describe the process you went through to deploy the project to a hosting platform (e.g. GitHub Pages or Heroku).

In particular, you should provide all details of the differences between the deployed version and the development version, if any, including:

Different values for environment variables (Heroku Config Vars)?
Different configuration files?
Separate git branch?
In addition, if it is not obvious, you should also describe how to run your code locally.
